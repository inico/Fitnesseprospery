Help: Suite demonstrating (nested) suites based on a single definition, but with different configuration using variables.
Suite
---
This suite is quite strange, but demonstrates a powerfull concept: it contains a test (to be run manually) which updates the wiki itself, so that a whole family of test suites can be maintained from single source.

The real test contents of each suites are defined by a single 'source suite' which is parameterized using wiki symbols ([[_TestDefinition.ParameterizedTests][.HsacAcceptanceTests.SlimTests.UtilityFixtures.GeneratedSymbolicLinkSuite._TestDefinition.ParameterizedTests]]).
This suite is embedded in suites defining values for all parameters using symbolic links (>EnLocaleTests and >NlLocaleTests). These are the tests which are normally run.
A single test page (>SuiteGenerator) contains a table definining the variables for each of these suites, so that an easy overview is available.
Running this last test page actually overwrites the existing wiki pages for each of the suites defining the tests that are normally run (during a normal run this test page is skipped).
This ensures all suites are consistent with the overview, and removes the need to manually edit each individual page each time a variable is added.
